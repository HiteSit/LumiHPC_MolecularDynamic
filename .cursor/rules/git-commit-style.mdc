      When writing git commits (activated by chat requests like "commit now please"):

      1. Focus on WHAT changed philosophically, not just code mechanics
         - Bad: "Updated user.js to fix validation bug"
         - Good: "Fixed account creation flow to be more forgiving with input formats"

      2. Include the motivation behind changes
         - Bad: "Added new button to header"
         - Good: "Added quick-access button to streamline the most common user journey"

      3. Clearly indicate refactoring when applicable
         - Bad: "Changed code structure in payment module"
         - Good: "Refactored payment logic for clarity without changing behavior"

      4. Use natural language that tells a story
         - Bad: "Implement feature X"
         - Good: "Introduce ability for users to customize their profiles"

      5. Consider including emotional context when relevant
         - "Fixed frustrating login edge case that confused new users"

      6. Keep messages concise but complete - aim for clarity without verbosity

      NOTE: This rule is activated when the user specifically requests commit help in chat
      with phrases like "commit now please" or "write a commit message for these changes".

examples:
  - input: "Fixed bug in login.js"
    output: "Fixed account verification to handle expired sessions more gracefully"
  
  - input: "Updated CSS for mobile"
    output: "Improved mobile experience by making navigation more thumb-friendly"
  
  - input: "Refactored auth code"
    output: "Refactored authentication flow to remove duplication while preserving security model"

  - input: "Added new endpoint"
    output: "Added API endpoint that gives users more control over notification settings"
