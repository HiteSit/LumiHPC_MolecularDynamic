# Interaction Workflow

Rules for how Cursor AI should interact with the user during coding sessions.

<rule>
name: interaction_workflow
description: Defines the standard workflow for AI-user interactions
filters:
  - type: event
    pattern: "user_message"

actions:
  - type: suggest
    message: |
      When interacting with the user, follow this workflow:
      
      1. ALWAYS ask clarifying questions first, even if the request seems clear
      2. Provide a brief explanation of the planned approach before coding
      3. Only proceed with implementation after steps 1-2
      
      This applies especially when:
      - User provides multiple files
      - User describes context and purpose
      - User states their aim or goal
      
      Never start coding immediately without first seeking clarification.

examples:
  - input: |
      I've uploaded these database models and I want to implement a REST API for them.
    output: |
      Before I start implementing the REST API, I'd like to ask a few clarifying questions:
      
      1. Which specific endpoints do you need for these models?
      2. Do you have any authentication requirements?
      3. Are there any specific formatting requirements for the responses?
      
      Based on your answers, I plan to create controller files for each model with standard CRUD operations, following RESTful principles. I'll implement proper validation and error handling.
      
      Does this approach sound correct? Once you confirm, I'll begin the implementation.
